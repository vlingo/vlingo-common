/**
 * {@code Completes<T>} models the eventual completion of an asynchronous operation
 * that has an answer (return value) of a specific type. You will find this
 * similar to {@code Future} and {@code CompletableFuture} from the Java platform. Yet,
 * {@code Completes<T>} is designed for non-blocking and is typically used in
 * that manner. There is a means to explicitly block on the outcome but
 * this is used only for testing.
 *
 * <p>
 * Use {@code Completes<T>} beyond handling the eventual outcome of asynchronous outcomes.
 * For example, use a pipeline of multiple {@code Completes<T>} when you must send a number
 * of asynchronous messages for multiple outcomes, but each outcome must precede the next.
 * Thus, while each message send is entirely asynchronous, {@code Completes<T>} manages the
 * sequencing of each message and its outcome with the possibility of each outcome being used
 * for the next message send. {@code Completes<T>} is a monad.
 *
 * <code>
 * reservations
 *    .reserveTravel(ticketingDetails)
 *    .andThenTo(reservation -&gt; booking.record(reservation))
 *    .andThenTo(bookingRecord -&gt; traveler.bookFor(bookingRecord))
 *    .andThenTo(points -&gt; rewards.credit(points));
 * </code>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that the various forms of {@code andThenTo()} pipeline using a nested {@code Completes<T>}
 * instance, making it possible for the registered {@code Function<T,O>} to send an asynchronous
 * message to an actor with without damaging the parent {@code Completes<T>}. Using {@code andThen()}
 * to send an asynchronous message to an actor will have undefined results.
 *
 * Note that the {@code Completes<T>} doesn't necessarily need to be executed when there is an outcome
 * if there is no subscription to it. Deciding when to run is implementation dependent, and is encouraged
 * to subscribe to the {@code Completes<T>} using the {@code andFinallyConsume} method.
 *
 * @param <T> the type that is expected as the outcome (return value)
